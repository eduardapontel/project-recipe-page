                <h2>Preparation</h2>
                <p>
                    In a blender, blend the water, instant coffee, eggs, oil, sugar, and cocoa powder until smooth.
                    Transfer to a bowl, add the flour and baking powder, and mix with a spoon. Pour into cupcake molds
                    lined with paper cups and place in a large pan, side by side. Bake in a preheated medium oven for 25
                    minutes or until baked and golden. Remove and let cool. <br><br>
                    For the filling, cook all ingredients over medium heat, stirring well until thickened. Turn off the
                    heat, let it cool, and place it in a pastry bag fitted with a round tip. Set aside. Place the
                    whipped cream in a pastry bag fitted with a star tip and set aside. <br><br>
                    To assemble, make a hole in the center of the cupcakes and fill with the reserved coffee brigadeiro.
                    Decorate the tops of the cupcakes with the reserved whipped cream, making circles. Decorate with
                    coffee beans and refrigerate until ready to serve.
